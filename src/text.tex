\section{About}

The s21\_3D\_Viewer\_v1 has a graphical interface written using the qt5.
Calculator was developed on the Ubuntu 22.04.

The s21\_3D\_Viewer\_v1 implements a program to view 3D wireframe models (3D Viewer) in the C programming language. The models themselves must be loaded from .obj files and be viewable on the screen with the ability to rotate, scale and translate.

\begin{itemize}
    \item build - builds an executable from source files
    \item install - installs the program as it is accepted by the Linux environment for the current user (the icon appears in the application menu)
    \item uninstall - deletes the program as is customary in the Linux environment for the current user
    \item test - running unit tests of modules related to expression evaluation using the Check library
    \item gcov\_report - displays information about code coverage by tests
    \item dist - creating an archive containing the distribution
  delivery of this program
    
  \end{itemize}
